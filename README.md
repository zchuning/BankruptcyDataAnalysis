# Bankruptcy Data Analysis

Dataset: [Polish companies bankruptcy data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data)

This is a final project for the Fall 2019 iteration of [CIS520 Machine Learning](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~cis520/wiki/). We aim to identify predictive features of business failure (i.e. bankruptcy) via a collection of descriminative machine learning models. Results are shown in Report.pdf.
